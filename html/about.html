    <div class="content"><h1>About this site</h1><p><strong>This website is designed as a workbook for interactive media by Tessa Atkinson 1266985</strong> <br><br>
    I have incorporated the theme of casino games into the visual and design aspect of this project in order to comment on the futile practise of gambling. It a a practise in which we often interact with media such as slot machines and roulette boards which has a genuine negative impact on society. As I begin my journey into creating and sharing on the World Wide Web I feel there is an inadequacy of supervision and policing. Morality and security is becoming more and more blurred as technology advances. My site aims to make users think about the negative impacts of interactivity by playing impractical games whilst simultaneously encouraging them to interact with it and inform them on my exploration and development throughout the interactive media subject and the virtual space which it inhabits. I hope to show my process and improvement over time and use this page as a critical investigation using my unique design choices.</p>
